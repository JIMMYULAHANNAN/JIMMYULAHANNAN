**Projects**

| **Project** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **[Injury Prediction](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/Injury_Prediction)** |A machine learning-based web app that predicts athlete injury risk using XGBoost and Streamlit. |
| **[Recurrent Neural Network](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/Recurrent_Neural_Networks/blob/main/README.md)** |Utilizing Keras and RNN (LSTM), this project preprocesses time-series data, trains a deep learning model, and accurately forecasts future alcohol sales trends. |
| **[Indian Population Forecast](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/Indian_Population_Forecast/blob/main/README.md)** |Using Auto Regression and data visualization, this project preprocesses historical data, trains a predictive model, and forecasts India's future population trends with accuracy. |
| **[Holt-Winter Forecasting Method](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/Holt-Winters_Forecast_Method/blob/main/README.md)** |Leveraging the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model, this project preprocesses time-series data, optimizes trend and seasonality components, and forecasts future airline passenger demand with precision. |
| **[Denoising Image](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/Denoising-Image/blob/main/README.md)** | This project implements a convolutional autoencoder to denoise images by learning to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs using deep learning. |
| **[Plant Disease canopy](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/plant_canopy/blob/main/README.md)** | This project develops a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-class image classification, incorporating preprocessing, data augmentation, and visualization for improved model performance and interpretability. |
| **[Web Scraping](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/Web_Scraping/blob/main/README.md)** | The project demonstrates web scraping using Python's requests and BeautifulSoup to extract authors, quotes, tags, and 2-star book titles from dynamically paginated websites. |
| **[Netflix Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/Netflix_dataset_Analysis/blob/main/README.md)** | Analyzing the Netflix dataset to uncover insights on duplicates, null values, top contributors, release trends, ratings, and content categories using pandas and data visualization techniques. |
| **[TIC TAC TOE](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/TIC_TAC_TOE/blob/main/README.md)** |This code implements a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns to place their markers ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid, with win conditions, error handling for invalid moves, and the option to replay the game. |
| **[SQL Combined with Tableau](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/SQL_combined_with_Tableau/blob/main/README.md)** | The provided SQL queries analyze employee data, focusing on gender breakdowns, salary comparisons, manager demographics, and customized salary ranges, with results visualized in Tableau. |
| **[MySQL Sample Exercise](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/MySQL_solved_exercise/blob/main/README.md)** |The SQL queries demonstrate various techniques like aggregation, subqueries, joins, triggers, stored procedures, and user-defined functions to manage and analyze employee data, including salary details, department assignments, and employee roles. |

Feel free to explore these projects to see how I apply my skills to solve real-world data challenges.
