**Projects**

| **Project** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **[Denoising Image](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/Denoising-Image/blob/main/CNN%20Model%20Image%20denoising%20.ipynb)** | This project implements a convolutional autoencoder to denoise images by learning to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs using deep learning. |
| **[Plant Disease canopy](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/plant_canopy/blob/main/README.md)** | This project develops a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-class image classification, incorporating preprocessing, data augmentation, and visualization for improved model performance and interpretability. |
| **[Web Scraping](https://github.com/JIMMYULAHANNAN/Web_Scraping/blob/main/README.md)** | The project demonstrates web scraping using Python's requests and BeautifulSoup to extract authors, quotes, tags, and 2-star book titles from dynamically paginated websites. |
| **[Financial Data Analysis](https://github.com/)** | Analyzed financial statements in Excel to assess company health and inform investment decisions. |
| **[Survey Data Cleaning](https://github.com/)** | Utilized Python and MySQL to clean and preprocess large survey datasets, ensuring data quality for subsequent analysis. |
| **[AB Testing for Marketing Campaigns](https://github.com/)** | Designed and analyzed A/B tests in R to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing strategies and improve conversion rates. |
| **[Supply Chain Optimization](https://github.com/)** | Applied statistical analysis and Excel modeling to enhance supply chain efficiency and reduce operational costs. |

Feel free to explore these projects to see how I apply my skills to solve real-world data challenges.
